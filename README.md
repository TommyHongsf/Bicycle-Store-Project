# Bicycle-Store-Project
Data analysis and visualization project for the Executive Team at a theoretical Bicycle Retail Store. 
Data is combined and pulled from SQL and then imported into Excel/Tableau for visualization in the form of a dynamic dashboard.

Install and run:
1. Create database named "BikeStores"
2. [BikeStores Sample Database - create objects.sql] is used to create the empty objects/tables in database named BikeStores
3. [BikeStores Sample Database - load data.sql] is used to fill in the information into the empty tables - should end up with 8 tables in the database
4. Information from the 8 tables are joined together using [BikeStore Project.sql] with relevant data pulled about customer information, order details, and revenue.


Relevant data is then imported into Excel (Google Sheets) and pivot tables are used to created a dynamic dashboard with slicers for easy filtering:

A similar dashboard is also created in Tableau as well:
